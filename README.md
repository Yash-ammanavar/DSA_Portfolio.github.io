In today's day and age, more and more people are relying on online food delivery applications to order food. With this, comes new challenges with respect to storage, networking, delivery, etc. Using of DSA concepts, algorithms and data structures is very useful to tackle these challenges. 

### Functionalities

### Optimal Delivery Route

Function: Determines the quickest delivery route for drivers to ensure timely deliveries, enhancing customer satisfaction.
Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph, ensuring deliveries are made in the least amount of time possible.
Alternative: A* Search Algorithm can be used if you have heuristic information about the distances, which can speed up the search process.
